      <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
      <h5><em>&quot;Bird. One of 17 species of macaws, the scarlet macaw is one of the most beautiful members of the parrot family and one of the largest Neotropical parrots. Scarlet macaws prefer life in the rainforest. With wide strong wings and hollow bones that aid flight, they can reach speeds of 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour. The scarlet macaw has a strong, curved beak to crack hard nuts and seeds, and a tongue that can hold onto the kernel to pull it from the shell. They eat clay from riverbanks, though no one is sure why. Males and females both look the same. While some learn to speak, most macaws have limited ability to mimic.</em>&quot;</h5>

  <p><em>&quot;Members of the parrot family carry Newcastle disease, identified in 1971, which can infect native songbirds, game birds, domestic chickens and turkeys, and other exotic bird species. The native bird species can be infected by smuggled exotic birds and birds not properly quarantined that are released into the wild. This species also breeds in cavities which might limit the number available to native cavity nesters.</em>&quot;</p>
